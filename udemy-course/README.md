## [Stacks & Queues problems](stack_queue)

### [Max in a stack problem overview](stack_queue/max_in_stack.py)
The aim is to design an algorithm that can return the maximum item of a stack in `O(1)` running time complexity. 
We can use `O(N)` extra memory!

### [Queue with stack problem](stack_queue/queue_on_stack.py)
The aim is to design a queue abstract data type with the help of stacks.
