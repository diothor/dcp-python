# Algorithms & Data Structures in Python
I used this project to learn Python and sharpern my programmic skills. You may find here solution for some algorithmic riddles, 
implementations of algorithms (e.g. sorting, searching in graph) or data structures examples (e.g. heap, stack).

## [Daily Coding Problems](problems)
Here you will find my solutions for some of algorithmic riddles from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).

## [Udemy Algorithms Course questions](udemy-course)
On Udemy there is cool [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/algorithms-and-data-structures-in-python/) about 
algorithms and data structures. It contains some interview problems for each chapter. Solutions for these questions 
can be found in this section. 

## [Sort Algortithms](sort)
There are implementations of sorting algorithms here. All of them are tested with the same test suite, so you may easily 
compare their performance.

## [Data Structures](data-structures)
It holds implementations of :
* [min heap](data-structures/heap)
* [trie](data-structures/trie)
