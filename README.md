# Algorithms & Data Structures in Python
I used this project to learn Python and sharpern my programmic skills. You may find here solution for some algorithmic riddles, 
implementations of algorithms (e.g. sorting, searching in graph) or data structures examples (e.g. heap, stack).

## [Daily Coding Problems](problems/)
Here you will find my solutions for some of algorithmic riddles from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).

## [Sort Algortithms](sort/)
There are implementations of sorting algorithms here. All of them are tested with the same test suite, so you may easily compare their performance.

## [Data Structures - *Under development!*](data-structures/)
It holds only a heap implementation so far.
